# Critical-HealthCare-Assessments-Using-WBAN-and-SVM
Developed novel collaboration of IoT, WBAN, machine learning, cloud computing 
and mobile computing together to create a more reliable healthcare assessment 
system. 

The basic idea of the project was to design a reliable decision making 
system with remote handling of patient health with accuracy.

The sensors will transfer data from patient to a server using ESP8266 and Wi-Fi called as WBAN network. 

The server will then apply SVM machine learning algorithm on the sensor readings and classify in two categories safe and unsafe. 

Custom made training dataset will be used to train the SVM
